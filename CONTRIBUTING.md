## Code style
Many conventions are available for writing code, but in this repo there's only one correct and that's mine :)

Please use the following conventions:

* No tabs, only spaces.
* Indention is done by 2 spaces width.
* Always append with an `;`.
* Try to obey [JSHint](http://jshint.com) rules.
* Install [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) to help with above and more rules.
* Follow the conventions you see used in the source already.
